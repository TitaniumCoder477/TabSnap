.SYNOPSIS 
Saves your collection of Chrome windows and tabs

.DESCRIPTION
TabSnap is a simple, robust, open-source backup tool for your open tabs!
This extension lets you save a "snap" of all your open windows and tabs. It was born from pure frustration when I lost all my tabs, and all the known methods of getting them back (such as "Reopen closed window") failed to help me.

This extension will help you prepare for that inevitable moment!

This is only version 2.0 of my extension, so be kind and patient. There are more features to come!

Currently:
- You can save snaps
- You can load snaps

But you can't delete old snaps, so be choose your save moments wisely! Maybe save only when you really do have a lot open that you would die if you lost!

You also can't name snaps conveniently yet.

Upcoming features I hope to add:
- Delete snaps
- Schedule auto snaps
- Set/rename snaps
